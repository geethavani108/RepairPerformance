Repair Performance Project
Overview
This project aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of repair processes by leveraging data analysis, machine learning, and predictive maintenance techniques.

Introduction
The Repair Performance project focuses on optimizing repair operations through advanced analytics. It aims to predict equipment failures, minimize downtime, and improve overall maintenance strategies.

Features
Predictive Maintenance: Utilizes machine learning models to predict equipment failures before they occur.

Data Visualization: Provides insightful visualizations of maintenance data to identify patterns and trends.

Performance Metrics: Tracks and analyzes key performance indicators (KPIs) related to repair efficiency.

Automated Alerts: Sends notifications for upcoming maintenance tasks or potential issues.
